This page is primarily for use on how I setup different parts of my website. It is a work in progress and will be updated as I make changes to my website.


## Disable line numbers

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Steps>

1. Use `<Code>` block. As seen here:

    https://expressive-code.com/key-features/code-component/

2. Follow the installation on Line Numbers here:

    https://expressive-code.com/plugins/line-numbers/

3. Add `meta="showLineNumbers=false"` to the `<Code>` block.

    ```mdx
    <Code code="add code here" lang="shell" meta="showLineNumbers=false" />
    ```

4. Line numbers will **not** be shown on the code block.

</Steps>
